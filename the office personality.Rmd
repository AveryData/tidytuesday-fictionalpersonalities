This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Get all the data
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2022-08-16')
characters <- tuesdata$characters
stats <- tuesdata$psych_stats
```


```{r}
# Get the stats for the office 
the_office = stats %>% filter( uni_name == "The Office")

# choose the characteristics we want
traits = c("playful", "opinionated", "awkward", "emotional", "dramatic", "playful", "flirtatious", "bold", "trusting")

# Narrow it down to those traits 
the_office_small = the_office %>% filter( personality %in% traits)

# only keep the important columns
the_office_small = the_office_small[,c('char_name', 'personality', 'avg_rating')]

# get rid of duplicates
the_office_small = the_office_small %>% distinct(char_name, personality, .keep_all = TRUE)

# Pivot
comparision = the_office_small %>% pivot_wider(names_from = personality, values_from = avg_rating)

# Replace NaN's with averages
comparision = comparision %>% 
  mutate_if(is.numeric, ~replace_na(.,mean(., na.rm = TRUE)))

# Keep the characters you want 
chars = c('Michael Scott', 'Jim Halpert', 'Pam Beesly', 'Dwight Schrute' ,'Andy Bernard')
comparisoin_small = comparision %>% filter( char_name %in% chars)


```

```{r}
comparisoin_small %>% 
     mutate_each(funs(rescale), -char_name) %>%
     ggradar()

```
